        Pollution refers to the introduction of harmful substances into the environment, resulting in adverse effects on living beings and the planet. It can take many forms, including air, water, soil, and noise pollution.

        Air pollution is caused by emissions from vehicles, industries, and burning of fossil fuels. Water pollution results from the dumping of industrial waste, sewage, and chemicals into water bodies. Soil pollution is caused by excessive use of pesticides, deforestation, and improper waste disposal. Noise pollution stems from loud sounds produced by machinery, transportation, and urban activities.
